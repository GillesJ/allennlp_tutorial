# AllenNLP Tutorial

This tutorial is meant to teach you both how to use AllenNLP and a principled approach to doing deep learning research in NLP.
The content is mirrored (**and updated**) on my personal site: [jbarrow.ai](https://jbarrow.ai/#allennlp).
If you're interested in reading the latest version, you can find it there.
But the code will always be stored in this repository.
It consists of 10 sections, and I recommend you do them in order:

0. [Setup](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/0_Setup.md)
1. [Building a Dataset Reader](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/1_Building_a_Dataset_Reader.md)
2. [Building a Baseline Model](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/2_Building_a_Model.md)
3. [Configuring Experiments](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/3_Configuring_Experiments.md)
4. [Tackling Your Own Experiments](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/4_Tackling_Your_Own_Experiments.md)
5. [Predictors](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/5_Predictors.md)
6. [Debugging](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/6_Debugging.md) [WIP]
7. [Advanced Modeling: Hierarchical LSTMs, CRF Decoding, and BERT](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/7_Advanced_Modeling.md) [WIP]
8. [Digging Into the Documentation](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/8_Documentation.md) [WIP]
9. [Hyperparameter Search: AllenTune](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/9_AllenTune.md) [WIP]
10. [Appendix: Migrating from AllenNLP 0.9 to 1.0](https://github.com/jbarrow/allennlp_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/A1_Migrating_to_1_0.md) [WIP]

The tutorial makes no assumptions about familiarity with AllenNLP, and goes through using it as an experimental platform, using JSON configurations.
